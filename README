directory in breadth-first order. The program can be invoked in the
following way:

The options listed above are interpreted in the following way:

	h	Print a help message and exit
	L	Follow symbolic links, if any.
	t	Print a character indicating the type of the file
	p	Print user, group, and other permissions as rwxrwxrwx
	i	Print the number of links to each file in inode table
	u	Print the UID associated with the file
	g	Print the GID aassociated with the file
	s	Print the size of the file
	d	Print the time of last modification
	l	Prints information as if options tpiugsd are specified

The directory is specified as the positional argument after options. If no
directory is specified, the current working directory will be used.

To compile the program, simply type 'make' in the project directory. Type
'git log' to access a log of how the program files are modified.
